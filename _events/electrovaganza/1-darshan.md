Electrovaganza was an awesome event held post Get Electrified 2. It was 
an electronics hackathon where we had to complete a project alloted to us
in one night. The second get electrified session taught us about op-amps
and various sensors. So the projects (speedometer,pedometer,air guitar)
in electrovaganza mainly concentrated on this topics. We had formed groups
of 8 students and each group was alloted one project and a mentor. It was 
a great learning experience as our group designed the circuit from scratch
or the first time. We got to learn as many as three ICs during the course
of project. And yes, we faced lots of problems while making the project but
the mentors helped us debugg and complete our projects in time.
