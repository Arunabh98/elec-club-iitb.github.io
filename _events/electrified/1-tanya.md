Get electrified sessions gave an introduction to electronics, catering
essentially to the freshmen. I had attended the second session in which
mentors explained basic yet useful electronic circuits involving op-amps
and sensors to groups of 6 to 8. Small groups made it very interactive.
It was informative with little hands-on and things were explained in a
simplistic manner, thus serving its purpose well.
