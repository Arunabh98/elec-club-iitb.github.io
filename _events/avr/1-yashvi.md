AVR workshop was the first event that I attended of electronics club and
it was a great learning experience for me. It was a two day workshop,
7-8 hours each day and covered basics of microcontroller, ADC, PWM,
timers, LCD etc. All the mentors were well prepared and taught us well
and cleared all our doubts properly. And the workshop was really fun,
not at all boring or monotonous. I learned a lot from the workshop and
it will definitely help me in my future electronic projects.
